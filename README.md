# AdventOfCode

2023
This will be my 2nd attempt at Advent of Code. 
I will be using C# in Visual Studio code. 


2022
This is my first Advent Of Code and I will be using Vanilla Javascript.
I am currently using Visual Studio Code and in the terminal running "node app.js" to show the solution.


I wasn't able to complete this as I was working on the Portfolio projects. 
However, next year I will be looking to get more of Advent Of Code complete.
